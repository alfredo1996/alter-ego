/**
 * This drives the real TanStack hooks against a backend whose reads hang, fail
 * or resolve, because the bug lived in TanStack's isPending/isLoading split.
 *
 * Budgets and savings goals derive their list from the query, so a failed first
 * load used to read as an empty list ("No budgets yet") instead of an error.
 *
 * Some finance pages rendered once their main query landed and let the rest pop
 * in: the dashboard's budget, bill and goal cards, the reports' lower sections,
 * and transaction rows whose account read "Unknown" until accounts arrived.
 * `reads.hang` holds back just those reads while every other one resolves.
