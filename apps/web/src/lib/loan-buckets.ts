/**
 * Who owes what on a loan account, one bucket per person.
 *
 * The person is read off the description: money lent to people is written
 * "Soldi Alice", so the remainder after a leading "Soldi" is the name, and a
 * description with no such prefix ("Capodanno") is a bucket of its own. No
 * fuzzy matching: a typo makes a second bucket the owner fixes by editing the
 * description. ponytail: a counterparty field is the upgrade path, if the
 * description ever proves too noisy.
 *
 * Every row of the account counts, transfers or not, through `txDelta`, so the
 * buckets' balances add up to the account's balance less its opening one: an
 * adjustment or an expense gets its own bucket instead of breaking that sum.
